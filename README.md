# docker-beginner-workshop-app
A simple beginner-friendly fullstack example built for an introductory Docker workshop. Includes a Vite frontend, a FastAPI backend (Python 3.7 compatible), and a MySQL database. The goal is to learn how to containerize each part as separate services and run them together using Docker.
